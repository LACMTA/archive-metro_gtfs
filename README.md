## DEC12 GT Standalone

This is the complete Bus & Rail GT Feed.
 
It HAS been Validated.
 
Note that the structure (especially of the calendar) for Rail will be a little different than
you are used to (in that there will be a lot of date-specific service, rather than date-ranges).
 
This represents our first rail export directly from HASTUS.
 
I will push the combined JUN12 – DEC12 Combination Feed out to you by Friday (and hopefully before that).
Since THAT is the first feed Google Needs, I did NOT push the DEC12 Standalone out to the Dev Site, since
I’d like as few possibilities for constructive dissonance as possible.
